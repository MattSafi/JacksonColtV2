        Jackson Colt embodies the spirit of 80s rock with a modern twist. His
        music captures the essence of the golden age of guitar with infectious
        choruses, melodic riffs, and electrifying solos. Influenced by classic
        rock legends, Jackson blends retro vibes with a fresh, contemporary
        sound that resonates across generations. His journey began at age 9 when
        he picked up his first guitar from a second-hand store, learning tracks
        from icons like Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Who, and Grand Funk
        Railroad. Growing up immersed in the sounds of Deep Purple, AC/DC, Def
        Leppard, and Guns N&apos; Roses, Jackson credits his family for shaping
        his timeless rock-inspired style.
